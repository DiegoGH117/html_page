Introduction
============

``ppxf_assistant`` is a small package designed to apply the PPxF method to Integrated Field Spectra (IFS), with an aim to make it also more interactive.

Motivation
**********

To make the usage of PPxF easier and more interactive. 


Limitations
***********

- Currently it only works with NIFS data

- Still missing the creation of some output files (errors and temp_weights).


Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
